# PV Solar Dashboard with AI-based Cybersecurity Detection

This is a web application that serves as a dashboard for monitoring solar panel installations, along with an AI-based cybersecurity detection system that helps identify potential threats to the system.

The dashboard is built using the following technologies:

* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to build web applications and servers using JavaScript.
* MongoDB: A NoSQL document database that stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, allowing for flexible data modeling.
* Express: A web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for building web applications, including routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses.
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allows for the creation of reusable UI components.
* JavaScript: A programming language used for building web applications.

# Getting Started

# How it Works

The solar dashboard allows users to monitor solar panel installations and view data related to their performance. Additionally, the dashboard includes an AI-based cybersecurity detection system that helps identify potential threats to the system.

The AI-based cybersecurity detection system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from the solar panel installations and identify potential cybersecurity threats. The system is designed to learn over time and improve its ability to detect threats as it receives more data.
